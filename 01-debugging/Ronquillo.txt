Which debugging technique do you like to use? Why?

I like two kinds of debugging techniques. First is Backtracking, the second is Collab Debugging.
Most of my errors when I code is something like using a cout statement for a Java program or 
misspelling the word "import" which is why I'm thankful that the compiler would point it out.
On the other hand, Collab Debugging is also helpful to me because I often make dumb mistakes
like initializing i to 0 instead of -1 and wondering why there's a stack overflow error.
